## Customize the Project Repository

You may find you need to customize the project template that your students copy their projects from, so that it contains prepped or customized data for analysis (note this is especially true if you are using the text analysis or topic modeling features of this module).
Follow these steps:

1. Following the [Copy Template Repository](/content/start/web-setup.html#template) instructions, copy the [Text Analysis template](https://github.com/learn-static/text-analysis).

2. Customize the data following the instructions on the [Voyant Data](/content/instructors/voyant-data.html) page. Customize other features of the site as desired.

3. Turn your customize repository into a template by navigating to the base of the repository on GitHub, clicking the "Settings" tab, and then checking the "Template repository" box underneath General > Repository name. 

4. Your students should now copy your newly-customized site instead of the standard Text Analysis project template.
