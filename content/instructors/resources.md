### Bootstrap 5

[Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) is a CSS framework designed to streamline developing user interfaces for your website.

[Bootstrap Icons](https://icons.getbootstrap.com/) are SVG-based icon set used to add graphics to your content.

### YAML

[YAML](http://www.yaml.org/) is a human readable plain text data format.
It is used in Jekyll for configuration, site data, and front matter.
Jekyll projects are [configured](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/configuration/) using the "_config.yml" file.

### Liquid

[Liquid](http://shopify.github.io/liquid/) is a flexible template language.
[In Jekyll]((https://jekyllrb.com/docs/liquid/) it allows you to layout pages built from modular components and data, using the "_includes", "_layouts", and "_data" directories.
Liquid includes features such as operators, loops, and filters to manipulate raw content. 
Liquid statements are enclosed by {% raw %}`{%  %}`{% endraw %} and variables in {% raw %}`{{  }}`{% endraw %}.

### Sass  

[Sass](http://sass-lang.com/) is a CSS extension / preprocessor. 
All normal CSS is valid SCSS, but Sass adds many powerful functions and programmatic features. 
Writing SCSS is often easier and more sensible, for example by supporting nesting, variables, and operators. 
Jekyll lets you write SASS in modular chucks called partials, in the "_sass" directory, that will be combined and compiled into normal CSS files when the site is built.
